This repository demonstrates a subtle but important quirk in PHP's pass-by-reference mechanism.  When a function modifies a nested array passed by reference, the changes might not propagate to the original array as intuitively expected.  The `bug.php` file illustrates the problem, and `bugSolution.php` offers a potential solution by explicitly creating copies of arrays before modification.
